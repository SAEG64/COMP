# Markov game with option "foraging" and "lurking"
The code creates 3 color tables:
1. 2x2 game types per state (LP and time-point; 12 game types)
2. Strategy of player 1 (cooperate/forage, defect/lurk, no preference)
3. Nash equilibria (strict, weak, no equilibrium)\n
\n
Colorbars decoding the tables are in separate file since they had to be custom created.
